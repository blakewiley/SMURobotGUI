# SMURobotGUI
This GUI is to be used with the SMU ME454 Controls and Automation robot. It allows the user to switch auto/manual, manually control the platoform, adjust motor speed, and experiment with the PID gains. To run you must have Python 2.7 and the PyQt4 library. The gui.py file contains the actual gui structure which was generated using QtCreator on Ubuntu. The main.py imports the gui.py file and handles the actual user interaction with the GUI.
